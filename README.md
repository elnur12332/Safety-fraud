information security on the Internet

Short description
This research project is dedicated to the problems of information security on the Internet and the development of solutions to improve user cybercrime. With the rapid growth of digitalization, the threat of cyber attacks such as virus attacks, phishing, data leaks and fraud is increasing.
The project has created two key solutions: An educational game based on the Umaigra platform, an interactive tool that teaches users the basics of information security, methods of protection against cyber attacks, and ways to identify fraudulent schemes. A program for checking messages and websites for fraud is a tool that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze suspicious messages and web resources in order to identify possible threats.
